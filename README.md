# Olympics_sim
Simulate different tournament structures in the olympic games

There are three Olympic tournament structures being simulated:
1. Heats
2. Single Elimination Brackets
3. Round Robins

The # athletes, the athletes skills/rankings going into the olympics are held fixed in fixed_vars.py

Use run_sim.py to generate simulations of all the tournament structures, and evaluate how often the top ranked athlete wins a medal in a given tournament.
